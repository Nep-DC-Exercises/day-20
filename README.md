# Modals, Bootstrap, JQuery

### Date: 9/25/19 W5/D3/D20

### Summary

We added additional div wrappers to the chuck-norris html, added some custom styles to control the appearance of the modal, and wrote javascript functions to control the appearance and disappearance of the modal. After writing this custom functionality, we were reminded that there are multiple libraries that have been written already that can handle various behaviors and to not "reinvent the wheel" if it can be avoided.

A few things learned today...

 1. CSS: There is a difference between chained classes e.g .wrapper--modal.open and child classes e.g .wrapper--modal .open.

2. JS: Any element can be assigned a click event. The classList.toggle method.

3. HTML: Additional wrappers around content can not only help with providing additional structure but it also aids in increasing specificity in case you need to override default styles from a css framework.

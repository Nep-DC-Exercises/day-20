# JS Modals, Bootstrap & JQuery

### Date: 9/25/19 W5/D3/D20

### Summary

We added additional div wrappers to the chuck-norris html, added some custom modal styles, and wrote javascript functions to control the toggling of the modal.

CSS: Overriding defaults from frameworks using specificity. Difference between chained classes .wrapper--modal.open and child classes .wrapper--modal .open.

JS: Every element can be clicked. 
.classList.toggle

HTML: additional wrappers around content can not only help with providing additional structure but aids in increasing specificity incase you need to override default styles from a css framework
